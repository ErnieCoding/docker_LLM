  "summary": "Here is a synthesized report of the business meetings:\n\n**Meeting 1: Alfa Bank Meeting**\n\n* Participants: Artem, Elizabeth, Max\n* Key Points:\n\t+ Artem will communicate with Oksana Sorenkova on behalf of Alfa Bank.\n\t+ The status with Alfa Bank remains unchanged, with a proposed total cost of $2 million (from $1.6 million).\n\t+ A meeting with MHI is scheduled for tomorrow to discuss the ITUC and Messenger Plus VKS contract.\n* Decisions Made:\n\t+ To proceed with the proposed terms with Alfa Bank (pending Oksana Sorenkova's confirmation).\n\t+ To meet with MHI tomorrow to

Alfa Bank (no deadline specified).\n\t+ Elizabeth and Max: Attend meeting with MHI tomorrow to discuss ITUC and Messenger Plus VKS contract.\n\t+ Speaker: Sign a new contract with SoftLine (Bialowiezh cheeses) today.\n\n**Meeting 2: Recruiting and Talent Management**\n\n* Participants: Artyom, Lena\n* Key Points:\n\t+ Feedback from previous stakeholders was not about the technical aspect but rather stability and reliability.\n\t+ Direct access to changeable people is seen as an \"island of reliability\" where decisions are made based on their input.\n\t+ The organization wants to provide a tool that will suit the needs of the supervisor's office, including tests if necessary.\n* Decisions Made:\n\t+ The organization will not collect special fees from AGI and other scientific institutions.\n\t+ They will proceed with a pilot mode for the digital profile system.\n* Assigned Tasks:\n\t+ Artyom: Conduct interviews (5-10) to assess top positions (deadline: before the new year or within one week if not possible).\n\t+ Lena: Add user to HRD's supervisor's office yesterday.\n\n**Meeting 3: Astra Project**\n\n* Participants: Unknown\n* Key Points:\n\t+ Astra uses AI to evaluate hard skills in job candidates.\n\t+ Initial tests have shown promising results, but there are concerns about its scalability.\n\t+ The tool is not yet fully integrated into the company's hiring process.\n* Decisions Made:\n\t+ To test Astra with several cases to further evaluate its effectiveness.\n\t+ To consider implementing Astra as a teaser for potential clients, such as IT companies.\n\t+ To revisit the proposal for a pilot program and make it more compelling.\n\n**Meeting 4: Pilot Project with Cherkizovo**\n\n* Participants: Dobrotsen, KP, Zharikov\n* Key Points:\n\t+ The pilot project with Cherkizovo will start in January.\n\t+ Four companies are participating in the pilot, including Rostec and MTS.\n\t+ A meeting is scheduled for tomorrow at 12:30 PM to discuss next steps.\n* Decisions Made:\n\t+ The pilot project with Cherkizovo will start in January.\n\t+ Next meeting will focus on translating goals and objectives into specific discussion mode.\n* Assigned Tasks:\n\t+ Dobrotsen: Prepare checklist for PERS data (immediate) and pass it on to the team.\n\t+ KP: Coordinate with Rostec and MTS on pilot project (no deadline specified).\n\t+ Zharikov: Provide feedback on second week of pilot (no deadline specified).\n\n**Meeting 5: Voice Assistant Development**\n\n* Participants: Max, IT Specialist\n* Key Points:\n\t+ The interview process will not be shortened.\n\t+ Reports must be prepared by December 20th.\n\t+ A voice assistant is being developed for use in a chat or voice mode.\n* Decisions Made:\n\t+ Streaming (immediate answers to questions) is not necessary yet.\n\t+ Current implementation of voice assistant is sufficient, but with some improvements: registration should only be required once per session, and template-based approach would allow users to ask follow-up questions without re-registering.\n* Assigned Tasks:\n\t+ Max: Implement next step in voice assistant development (template-based approach) and improve user experience (no deadline specified).\n\t+ IT Specialist: Review and implement improvements to voice assistant, including making it possible for users to enter their email address once and have access to their account without re-registering each time.\n\n**Meeting 6: Natusi Contract Termination**\n\n* Participants: Max, Len\n* Key Points:\n\t+ Client (Natusi) is experiencing issues with contract due to ambiguities in Technical Specification (TK).\n\t+ Team wants to improve user experience on their platform by making it easier for users to access and navigate.\n* Decisions Made:\n\t+ Max will come up with options for improving user experience on their platform.\n\t+ Team will provide a fully working solution that meets client's needs, rather than pursuing complaint to FAS.\n* Assigned Tasks:\n\t+ Max: Come up with options for improving user experience on their platform (no deadline specified).\n\t+ Len: Prepare letter to client regarding termination of contract and possibility of appealing to FAS.\n\n**Meeting 7: Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) Issue**\n\n* Participants: Speaker\n* Key Points:\n\t+ There may be a legal basis for appealing FAS decision.\n\t+ Speaker suggests preparing
