Alfa Bank's implementation will proceed in two stages, starting on the 26th.\n2. MHI (Mass Selection) pilot will require coordination with Oksana Sorenkova and potential price adjustments based on demand.\n3. Cherkizovo will enter the pilot program in January, followed by Rostec and SoftLine.\n4. The team will focus on providing a clear deadline for each pilot program to increase client engagement.\n5. Nornickel's implementation of a voice assistant chat is approved with context and prompts.\n\n**Assigned Tasks:**\n\n1. Artem will prepare an offer invoice for JINR and pass it quickly.\n2. Max will coordinate with the director of IT security at Alfa Bank, and come up with options for implementing a voice assistant chat that can handle user requests without re-registration for Nornickel.\n3. Lena will add the person in charge of recruiting at SoftLine to HRD's supervisor's office.\n4. Sasha will prepare a checklist for PERS data to share with Rostec and MTS.\n5. Oleg will write a letter to Nornickel explaining their decision and proposal.\n\n**Deadlines:**\n\n1. Alfa Bank implementation will start on the 26th (Chunk 1).\n2.
