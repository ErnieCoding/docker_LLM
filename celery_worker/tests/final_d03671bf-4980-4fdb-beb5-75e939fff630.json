  "summary": "Here is the synthesized report of the two meetings:\n\n**Meeting Report:**\n\n**Participants:** Artem, Dobrotsen, Max, Sasha, Len, Olya, and other unnamed participants.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. The team discussed ongoing projects with Alfa Bank, Rostex, MTS, Cherkizovo, and others.\n2. Astra's pilot program with Rostex has been completed, but there is still no feedback from the client.\n3. The team is working on a voice assistant for Norilsk Nickel, which will have a chat interface and be able to answer questions without streaming.\n4. The Alfa Bank project is progressing, with a meeting scheduled for December 26th to discuss further cooperation.\n5. The team discussed ways to make the pilot program more appealing and enticing for clients, including setting deadlines and providing clear goals.\n6. Artem will focus on developing a product for Cherkizovo and hopes to start implementing it in January.\n7. Dobrotsen's training with the development team was successful, and they will proceed with the assessment process.\n8. The voice assistant for Norilsk Nickel is aimed at creating a seamless experience for users, where they can ask questions without registering every time.\n9. The team decided to implement the voice assistant with a chat interface first and not pursue streaming at this stage.\n10. The team is willing to terminate the contract with Norilsk Nickel if necessary to clarify the Technical Specification (TK) and fulfill their needs.\n\n**Decisions Made:**\n\n1. Artem will develop a product for Cherkizovo and start implementing it in January.\n2. Dobrotsen will lead the assessment process with four regional directors on December 19-20.\n3. The development team will work with Dobrotsen to prepare reports and assist the assessors.\n4. The team will implement the voice assistant with a chat interface first and not pursue streaming at this stage.\n\n**Assigned Tasks:**\n\n1. Artem: Develop a product for Cherkizovo, starting implementation in January.\n2. Dobrotsen: Lead the assessment process with four regional directors on December 19-20.\n3. Max: Come up with options for creating a seamless experience for users within 3-4 hours.\n4. Len: Prepare a letter to send to Norilsk Nickel through unofficial channels, explaining the team's decision and proposal.\n5. Olya: Send an activation letter to Norilsk Nickel after the meeting.\n6. Development Team: Work with Dobrotsen to prepare reports and assist the assessors.\n\n**Deadlines:**\n\n1. Artem's product for Cherkizovo should be ready by January.\n2. The Rostex pilot meeting is scheduled for December 26th.\n3. Dobrotsen's assessment process with four regional directors will take place on December 19-20.\n4. Reports from the assessors are due by December 27th.\n5. Max needs to come up with options for creating a seamless experience within 3-4 hours.\n\n**Urgent Tasks and Decisions:**\n\nBased on the deadlines, the most urgent tasks to be completed are:\n\n1. Artem's product development for Cherkizovo (deadline: January).\n2. Dobrotsen's assessment process with four regional directors (deadline: December 19-20).\n3. Reports from the assessors (due by December 27th).\n\nTo prioritize these tasks, I recommend that Artem focus on developing the product for Cherkizovo, while Dobrotsen leads the assessment process and prepares reports to be submitted by December 27th.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n1. The team discussed ways to make the pilot program more appealing and enticing for clients, including setting deadlines and providing clear goals.\n2. Astra's success in hiring developers using AI was demonstrated with a case study, and it is suggested that this be shown as a teaser to potential clients.\n3. Feedback from clients should be prioritized, and the team should aim to collect feedback within a week of completing each pilot program.",
