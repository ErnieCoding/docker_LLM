  "summary": "Here's the synthesized report of the business meeting:\n\n**Meeting Minutes:**\n\n**Participants:** \n- Artem\n- Dobrotsen (Dobrotsen is mentioned in Chunk 1, but not in Chunk 2)\n- Maxim\n- Len\n- Oleg\n- Alexei Yurchin\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. The team discussed their current projects and progress with Alfa Bank.\n2. They reviewed the status of the pilot project with Rostex and discussed the challenges they were facing.\n3. The team also discussed the pilot project with MTS, which had already been completed, and prepared for a meeting to discuss the results.\n4. They talked about the potential pilot projects with Cherkizovo, Belovezhsky cheeses, and the Museum of St. Petersburg history.\n5. Artem mentioned that they need to create a checklist for PERS data and pass it on to Rostec before proceeding with the pilot project.\n6. The company is working on a project to automate assessments using AI.\n7. The assessors will have 2-3 days for interviews, and then they will prepare reports.\n8. The goal is to minimize the time spent by assessors on report preparation.\n\n**Decisions Made:**\n\n1. The team agreed to focus on the top 4 companies (Cherkizovo, Rostex, MTS, and Belovezhsky cheeses) for the pilot projects.\n2. They decided to enter the pilot project in Cherkizovo in January and continue with Rostec and other companies.\n3. The meeting scheduled with MTS will take place on December 26th at 12:30 PM.\n4. No decision was made regarding streaming in the voice assistant, but it was decided that a person can enter their email once and ask questions without needing to re-register each time.\n\n**Assigned Tasks:**\n\n1. Artem needs to fill out a checklist for PERS data and pass it on to Rostec.\n2. Dobrotsen has training sessions scheduled on December 19-20, where they will assess four regional directors.\n3. Maxim will work with the development team to prepare for the assessment process.\n4. **Max:** Think about how to implement a simpler way for users to ask questions in the voice assistant, such as using a 10-second pause between questions. Come up with options for storing user information and making it accessible without re-registering each time.\n5. **Len:** Prepare a letter to M2C regarding mutual termination of the contract.\n6. **Oleg:** Send an activation letter to Natusi.\n\n**Deadlines:**\n\n1. The pilot project with Cherkizovo is expected to start in January.\n2. Rostec and other companies are still in the harmonization stage.\n3. The meeting with MTS will take place on December 26th at 12:30 PM.\n4. Report preparation for the assessment project is expected to be completed by December 20th, with assessors taking a week to prepare reports if they are doing it themselves.\n\n**Urgent Tasks and Decisions:**\n\n1. Artem's checklist for PERS data needs to be completed as soon as possible so that Rostec can proceed with the pilot project.\n2. Dobrotsen's training sessions on December 19-20 have a tight deadline, which requires careful planning and preparation.\n3. Len's letter to M2C regarding mutual termination of the contract should be prepared and sent out as soon as possible after the meeting.\n\nGiven the information from both chunks, I would classify the following tasks as urgent:\n\n1. Artem's checklist for PERS data\n2. Dobrotsen's training sessions on December 19-20\n3. Len's letter to M2C regarding mutual termination of the contract\n\nThese tasks have specific deadlines and require timely completion to avoid any disruptions or delays in the project timeline.\n\nNote that some tasks, like Maxim's work with the development team, do not have explicit deadlines mentioned in the chunk summaries. However, considering the overall project goals and timelines, these tasks are likely to be urgent as well, even if they don't have specific deadlines mentioned.",
