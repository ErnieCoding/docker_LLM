She asks if she can go with him, but he rejects her request.\n\n**Chunk 5-6:** Holden and Phoebe engage in a series of arguments and rejections as they discuss whether or not she can join him on his trip. Despite their disagreements, they end up walking together to the zoo, where they become distracted by the sea lions' feeding.\n\n**Chunk 7:** The narrator and Phoebe are at odds with each other, but eventually warm up to each other at the zoo. They spend the afternoon together, and Phoebe gradually becomes more playful and carefree.\n\n**Chunk 8:** The narrator buys Phoebe a ticket to ride the carrousel and watches her enjoy herself.
