  "summary": "**Meeting Report**\n\n**Participants:**\n- Artem\n- Maxim\n- Sasha\n- Len\n- Development team members (unspecified)\n- Regional directors (unspecified)\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. The meeting revolves around updates on ongoing projects, including Alfa Bank, MHI, Rostex, and others.\n2. A pilot project with a company (not specified) is being considered but the current offer for the pilot is too vague to generate interest.\n3. To make the pilot more appealing, it's suggested that a deadline be set for completion, similar to how other projects are managed.\n4. Feedback from previous pilots has been limited or non-existent, and it's unclear if the companies are actively participating in the process.\n5. A new approach is proposed to streamline the evaluation process by using AI to generate reports, freeing up time for assessors.\n6. The company (Astra) will focus on a few key projects at once, prioritizing them from less to more complex.\n7. The pilot project with Cherkizovo will be entered in January, while Rostec and MTS will undergo harmonization before moving forward.\n8. A meeting is scheduled for tomorrow at 12:30 with MTS to discuss the next steps for the pilot.\n9. Improvements are being made to the voice assistant feature to reduce user effort and make it more convenient.\n10. Clarification of technical specifications (TK) needs to be done due to ambiguities, which may lead to contract termination if not resolved amicably.\n\n**Decisions Made:**\n\n1. The company will focus on a few key projects at once, prioritizing them from less to more complex.\n2. The pilot project with Cherkizovo will be entered in January.\n3. Rostec and MTS will undergo harmonization before moving forward with their pilots.\n4. A meeting is scheduled for tomorrow at 12:30 with MTS to discuss the next steps for the pilot.\n5. Improvements are being made to the voice assistant feature.\n6. Clarification of technical specifications (TK) needs to be done.\n\n**Urgent Tasks and Decisions:**\n\n1. Cherkizovo's pilot project is expected to start in January, with a deadline not specified but implied as urgent due to its early start date.\n2. Rostec and MTS will undergo harmonization before moving forward with their pilots, with no specific deadline mentioned but considered high priority.\n\n**Assigned Tasks and Deadlines:**\n\n1. Artem: Create a checklist for PERS data and pass it on to Rostec by an unspecified deadline.\n2. Development team: Assist in setting up rooms and tasks for the assessment process with Dobrozen.\n3. Maxim: Accompany the event with the regional directors, including writing down and processing their feedback.\n4. Len: Prepare a letter to send to the client regarding contract termination options and mutual dissolution of the contract.\n5. Max: Think about options for improving the voice assistant feature, including creating a quasi-personal account for users.\n\n**Deadlines:**\n\n1. Cherkizovo's pilot project is expected to start in January (urgent).\n2. Rostec and MTS will undergo harmonization before moving forward with their pilots (high priority).\n3. The assessment process with Dobrozen will take place on December 19-20, with a goal of completing the evaluation by the end of December.\n4. Reports for Norilsk Nickel's corporate security department are due on or before December 20th.\n5. Len's letter regarding contract termination options is to be prepared as soon as possible (short-term).",
