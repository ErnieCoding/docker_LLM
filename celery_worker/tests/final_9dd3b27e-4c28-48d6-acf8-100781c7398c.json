The corporate university will meet again in January to discuss individual assistant coaches.\n\n**Decisions Made:**\n\n1. Adjust the pilot project proposal to make it more relevant and deadline-driven.\n2. Start the pilot project conditionally through the pilot, but not until January.\n3.

Set a deadline for the next meeting with Rostex (Deadline: To be determined).\n2. Prepare a checklist for PERS data and pass it on to the SB and lawyers for coordination (Deadline: Not specified).\n3.
