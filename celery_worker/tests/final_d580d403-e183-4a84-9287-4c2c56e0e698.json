They addressed specific issues such as contract agreements and technical requirements for each project.\n3. The team agreed to focus on providing a turnkey solution for hiring and evaluation using Astra's AI-powered tools.\n\n**Decisions Made:**\n1. The pilot program with Rostec will be completed next year.\n2. MTS will enter the pilot program in January.\n3. SoftLine has paid for their contract, and the team needs to receive payment from them.\n4. Bialowieza cheeses wants to extend their contract, but there was a slight misunderstanding about the price.\n\n**Assigned Tasks:**\n1. Artem will coordinate with Max to improve the API phones for MHI.\n2. Dobrotsen (Dob) needs to prepare an invoice for the Institute of Nuclear Research.\n3. Artyom will interview top positions at Rostec, using Astra's tools to evaluate candidates' hard skills.\n4.

Next steps for Rostec and other companies will depend on the feedback from their pilots.\n\n**Urgent Tasks and Decisions:**\n\nBased on deadlines, here are the most urgent tasks to be completed:\n\n1. **MTS Pilot Meeting:** Dobrotsen (Dob) - Coordinate with Zharikov to provide feedback on the pilot project (Due tomorrow at 12:30 PM)\n2. **Assessment Process for Regional Directors:** Max - Develop a voice assistant that can answer questions and provide information to users without needing to register every time (Due by December 19-20)\n3. **Preparing Invoice for Institute of Nuclear Research:** Dobrotsen (Dob) - Prepare an invoice for the Institute of Nuclear Research (Date not specified)\n\n**Open Issues:**\n1. The team still needs to address the issue of giving a deadline for the pilot program, as many projects seem to be delayed due to lack of urgency.\n2. Some pilots are struggling with providing feedback, and the team needs to find ways to improve communication and engagement.\n\nNote: Deadlines for tasks from Chunk 2 have been included in the Urgent Tasks section above. The original deadlines from Chunk 1 remain intact.",
