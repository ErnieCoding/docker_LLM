  "summary": "**Meeting Report**\n\n**Date:** [Insert Date]\n**Attendees:** Artem, Max, Dobrotsen, Len, and other relevant team members.\n\n**1. Key Points of the Meeting:**\n\n1. Alfa Bank's status is good, with two stages in the process.\n2. MHI wants to agree on the total amount for their users.\n3. Technodrone has expanded twice in the last week.\n4. SoftLine and Belovezhsky Cheeses are signing a contract.\n5. The Museum of St. Petersburg History wants to extend their agreement.\n6. The Institute for Nuclear Research needs to pay before the New Year.\n7. RConf pilot is going well, but the customer wants a ready-made solution rather than developing it themselves.\n8. Assessment Process aims to reduce time spent on report preparation by assessors and assistants.\n9. Voice Assistant development allows users to ask questions without logging in every time.\n10. Contract termination with M2C due to ambiguities in TK and potential competition issues.\n\n**2. Decisions Made:**\n\n1. Sign a contract with SoftLine.\n2. Prepare an offer invoice for the Institute for Nuclear Research.\n3. Continue RConf pilot, focusing on showing a ready-made solution rather than developing it themselves.\n4. Provide a fully working solution to M2C, which would cover their needs and serve them faithfully.\n5. If M2C does not want this option, they may choose to mutually terminate the contract or allow the company to appeal FAS on competition issues.\n\n**3. Assigned Tasks with Deadlines:**\n\n1.
